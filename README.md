# LQM Converter
Java converter for LG's QuickMemo+ .lqm files. This tool is quite similar to [
QuickMemo-lqm-to-txt-File-Converter](https://github.com/powerpoint45/QuickMemo-lqm-to-txt-File-Converter), but it offers:
- An actual GUI;
- Proper support for memos that contain unicode characters;
- Ability to see the date of creation and last modification of each converted memo.

## Usage
GUI is boringly simple:

After launching it, simply select your .lqm file or folder that contains such, as well as folder where converted .txt files should be saved.<br>
Then press "**Convert!**" and watch the magic happen.
